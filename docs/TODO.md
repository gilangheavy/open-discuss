## 🛠 Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Database

- [ ] **Soft Delete Cleanup**: Soft-deleted data accumulates. Implement scheduled cleanup job or archiving strategy
- [ ] **Missing Indexes**: Add recommended indexes from PRD Section 4.7:
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_comments_thread_id ON comments(thread_id)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_replies_comment_id ON replies(comment_id)`
  - [ ] `CREATE INDEX idx_threads_date ON threads(date DESC)`

- [ ] **No Caching**: Consider Redis for frequently accessed threads
- [ ] **No Connection Pooling Monitoring**: Add metrics for pool usage

### Code Quality

- [ ] **Error Messages Consistency**: Some error messages in Indonesian, some in English
- [ ] **Magic Numbers**: Some hardcoded values (salt rounds, limits) should be in config
- [ ] **Presentation Logic in Handler**: Thread detail formatting could be in presenter layer

### Security

- [ ] **No Request ID Tracking**: Add request IDs for debugging
- [ ] **No API Versioning**: Future breaking changes will be difficult
- [ ] **Refresh Token Rotation**: Implement token rotation for better security

### Real-time Features

- [ ] **Real-time Notifications**: No WebSocket support for live updates
